Old Stuff: Deserts
1. Equation3DShapes, an abstract class for organizational purposes.
2. Desert, a class simulating a 3D surface that looks like a desert.
3. Editor, a class that lets you mess with the configuration of a Desert. You can get some pretty cool looking results, 
if you're willing to undergo the risk of a heapspace error.

New Stuff: Particles
1. PointParticles, a class that simulates a system of points that (can) undergo brownian motion. 
Requires an external timer to set up the movement.
2. GeneralParticles, similar to PointParticles, only this class allows you to input any 3D shape and subsequently produce a particle-system.
3. ParticleSystemViewer lets you look at both kinds of systems.

// Working to expand the latter 3 classes, but this is what I have so far.
