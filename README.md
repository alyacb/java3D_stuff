# java3D_stuff
I was playing around with Java3D a while ago, and these are some of the applets I wrote.

1. Equation3DShapes, an abstract class for organizational purposes.
2. Desert, a class simulating a 3D surface that looks like a desert.
3. Editor, a class that lets you mess with the configuration of a Desert. You can get some pretty cool looking results, 
if you're willing to undergo the risk of a heapspace error.
